HTML: Sets up the structure of the page, including inputs for the amount, currencies to convert from and to, and a button to trigger the conversion.
CSS: Provides basic styling to center the converter on the page and style the inputs, buttons, and result display.
JavaScript: Contains the conversion logic. The exchangeRates object holds the conversion rates between five currencies. When the user inputs an amount and selects currencies, the convertCurrency function calculates and displays the converted amount.
